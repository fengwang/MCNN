# Multi-scale Convolutional Neural Networks (MCNN)
---

MCNN extends the functionality of the hidden layers in the decoder of a U-Net by connecting them to additional convolution layers to produce coarse outputs, in attempt to match the low-frequency components.
This greatly accelerates the convergence and enhances the stability of the neural-network. The convergence curve with U-net is shown in the figure blow.
